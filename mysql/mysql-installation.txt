First, add the MySQL Yum repository to your system's repository list. 
This is a one-time operation, which can be performed by installing an RPM provided by MySQL. Follow these steps:

rpm -ivh mysql80-community-release-el8-1.noarch.rpm

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/linux-installation-yum-repo.html
(EL8 systems only) EL8-based systems such as RHEL8 and
 Oracle Linux 8 include a MySQL module that is enabled by default. 
Unless this module is disabled, it masks packages provided by MySQL repositories

yum module disable mysql

yum install mysql-community-server

systemctl start mysqld

systemctl status mysqld

ps -ef | grep mysql

cat /var/log/mysqld.log|grep temp

mysql -u root -p mysql

mysqladmin -u root -p password

mysql -u root -p mysql

select * from mysql.time_zone;

mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root -p mysql
